# EDA_JHDS_Course_Project_1
Exploratory Data Analysis course from John Hopkins University / Coursera Project 1

The overall goal here is simply to examine how household energy usage varies over a 2-day period in February, 2007 from dataset of Measurements 
of electric power consumption in one household with a one-minute sampling rate over a period of almost 4 years.
Different electrical quantities and some sub-metering values are available.

The task is to reconstruct the following plots below, all of which were constructed using the base plotting system.

For each plot was constructed the plot and saved it to a PNG file with a width of 480 pixels and a height of 480 pixels.

Name each of the plot files as 
plot1.png
plot2.png 
plot3.png
plot4.png

Create a separate R code file (
plot1.R
plot2.R
plot3.R
plot4.R

The code file include code for reading the data so that the plot can be fully reproduced, and also include the code that creates the PNG file.
